# GPQA Evaluation on leading models
Script + some result files. 
Run for my blog post on [small sample sizes in LLM evals](https://kamilelukosiute.com). 

Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku, as well as GPT 3.5T and latest GPT 4T all have 10 results each. There may be one or two other models with 1-2 runs, which I abandoned as soon as my wallet started bleeding (I'm not prepared to spend like $500 on API credits).
