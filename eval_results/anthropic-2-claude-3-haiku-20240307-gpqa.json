The bicistronic construct has the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. This suggests that the expression of the receptor and ligand is linked.\n\n4.

The lack of green signal in the fluorescent confocal microscopy of the offspring from the SOX10-Cre cross suggests that the receptor-eGFP construct is not being properly expressed or localized.\n\nThe most likely reason for the lack of green signal is:\n\n(C) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.\n\nThe stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP may have not been properly excised, leading to the receptor-eGFP fusion protein being trapped in the Golgi and not reaching the cell surface, where it would be expected to localize.\n\nThe answer is (C).", " \n\n1.

The effective temperature (Teff) of the star is 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K.\n4. The periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation can be mistaken for the presence of an exoplanet.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the size of an exoplanet and the amplitude of the brightness variation it would produce in the light curve of the host star.\n\nThe amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the host star's radius (Rpl/Rstar). A larger exoplanet would produce a larger amplitude variation.\n\nIn this case, the periodic brightness variations caused by the spotted hemisphere of the star are equivalent to having an exoplanet with a certain radius. To produce the same amplitude signal as the spotted star, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet should be proportional to the size of the spotted region on the star.\n\nSince the spotted region covers 20% of the star's surface, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet should be approximately 0.32 times the radius of the host star.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) ~0.32.\n\nThe answer is (B).", " \n\n1.

This change in mean free path is likely due to the interaction between the electrons in the beam and the gas molecules in the sample compartment.\n\nAs the electrons in the beam collide with the gas molecules, they can scatter the gas molecules, effectively reducing their mean free path. This is known as the \"electron scattering effect.\"\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that:\n(A) \u03bb2 >= 1.22*\u03bb1: This is incorrect because the electron scattering effect would decrease the mean free path, so \u03bb2 should be less than \u03bb1.\n(B) \u03bb2 < \u03bb1: This is the correct answer.

IR data:\n   - The broad band at 3400-2500 cm-1 indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n   - The peak at 1720 cm-1 is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) group, likely from the carboxylic acid.\n   - The peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests the presence of an aromatic ring.\n   - The peak at 1450 cm-1 is a common feature of aromatic compounds.\n\n2. 1H NMR data:\n   - The signal at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is characteristic of the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n   - The signals at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicate the presence of a para-substituted aromatic ring.\n   - The signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggest the presence of a sec-butyl group.\n\n3. Reaction with red phosphorus and HI:\n   - This reaction is likely a decarboxylation, where the carboxylic acid group is removed, and a hydrocarbon product is formed.\n\nConsidering the given information, the final product is most likely (B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.\n\nThe answer is (B).", " \n\n1. The cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are formed according to the following equilibria:\nCo^2+ + SCN- \u21cc Co(SCN)^+    (\u03b21 = 9)\nCo(SCN)^+ + SCN- \u21cc Co(SCN)2   (\u03b22 = 40)\nCo(SCN)2 + SCN- \u21cc Co(SCN)3^-  (\u03b23 = 63)\nCo(SCN)3^- + SCN- \u21cc Co(SCN)4^2- (\u03b24 = 16)\n\n2. To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, we need to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)4^2- and express it as a fraction of the total cobalt concentration.\n\n3. Using the stability constants and the given concentrations, we can calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes:\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 \u00d7 [Co^2+] \u00d7 [SCN-]^4 = 16 \u00d7 (10^-2) \u00d7 (0.1)^4 = 1.6 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 \u00d7 [Co(SCN)2] \u00d7 [SCN-] = 63 \u00d7 (40 \u00d7 (10^-2) \u00d7 (0.1)^2) \u00d7 0.1 = 2.52 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 \u00d7 [Co(SCN)^+] \u00d7 [SCN-] = 40 \u00d7 (9 \u00d7 (10^-2) \u00d7 0.1) \u00d7 0.1 = 3.6 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n[Co(SCN)^+] = \u03b21 \u00d7 [Co^2+] \u00d7 [SCN-] = 9 \u00d7 (10^-2) \u00d7 0.1 = 9 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n[Co^2+] = 10^-2 M (given)\n\n4. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the cobalt species:\n[Co]_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]\n[Co]_total = 10^-2 + 9 \u00d7 10^-4 + 3.6 \u00d7 10^-3 + 2.52 \u00d7 10^-3 + 1.6 \u00d7 10^-4 = 1.46 \u00d7 10^-2 M\n\n5. The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is:\nPercentage = [Co(SCN)4^2-] / [Co]_total \u00d7 100% = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-4) / (1.46 \u00d7 10^-2) \u00d7 100% = 1.1%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 16.9%.\n\nThe answer is (D)."]}
